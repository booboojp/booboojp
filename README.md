# **CHALLENGE**
Getting Started On the New Year early! I will be taking on some coding challenges for beginners because that is what I am. My goal is to complete them all before the end of the year. Yes, I know it will be hard but I believe I can do it! And after that, my new year's resolution will be better and more projects, certificates and things to show off!
##### Rules:
1. I am not allowed to copy and paste a lot of code from someeleses projects.
2. I have to use a new libary or API for each project.
3. I have to use React.js, I am trying to get better at it!
