Getting Started On the New Year early!
I will be taking on some coding challenges for beginners because that is what I am. My goal is to complete them all before the end of the year. Yes, I know it will be hard but I believe I can do it! And after that, my new year's resolution will be better and more projects, certificates and things to show off!
